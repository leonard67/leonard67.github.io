His research focuses on connecting accounting to the real world, analysing its role in social and political environments such as pandemics, global disruptions, and legal frameworks. He has a range of research interests including voluntary disclosure, shareholder litigation and stock price crash risk. He has published in leading accounting journals, including Journal of Accounting Research, Journal of Accounting and Economics, and Accounting, Organizations and Society. In addition, a number of his publications have been featured in prestigious industry practitioner journals, stimulating dialogue and innovation among practitioners, enhancing the application of academic research to solve real-world problems.

Leonard's teaching aims at enhancing students’ employability and equipping them for future challenges. He is at the forefront of integrating data analytics and machine learning within business education. This is reflected in the teaching and development of “COMM5601 – Interdisciplinary Application of Analytics”, "ACCT3672 – Accounting Analytics for Business Decision Making" and “ZZBU6509 – Financial Modelling”. He also teaches first-year accounting courses ("COMM1140 – Financial Management"), which employs innovative and flexible teaching methods that actively engage students and foster an interest in accounting.

Throughout his career, Leonard has dedicated his time to helping the next generation of researchers. He have assisted numerous early-career researchers in publishing in prestigious journals and have set high-quality research directions through his roles as an active reviewer in over 30 prestious international journals and as the Deputy Editor of Accounting & Finance. He is a co-founder of the Early Career Researchers Support Network (ECRSN), a network that aims to help early-career researchers to improve their social wellbeing and academic performance. This initiative supports researchers who have limited access to seminars and resources since the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling them to join the academic community and attend online master classes. This program has attracted over 100 participants from across Australia, New Zealand, and around the world.
