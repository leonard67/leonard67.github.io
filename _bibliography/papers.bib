  title={Flu Fallout: Information Production Constraints and Corporate Disclosure},
  abstract = {Using influenza epidemic data, we examine how constraints on corporate information production affect disclosure policies. We find that firms in areas with higher flu activity are less likely to issue short‐run earnings forecasts and more likely to issue long‐run earnings forecasts. These results are more pronounced when the information production process is more complex, when managers face a greater reputational loss for issuing low‐quality short‐run forecasts, and when firms’ costs of switching the forecast horizon are lower. Further analysis implies that the effect of flu activity on these forecast issuance decisions is not driven by firm performance or information uncertainty. Our results suggest that managers do not simply avoid issuing forecasts in response to information production constraints. Instead, they shift the forecast horizon from short‐run to long‐run, appearing to balance the costs of issuing low‐quality forecasts with those of not issuing forecasts at all.}

abstract = {We investigate how grief following the death of a CEO's former colleague affects management forecasts. Our results show that the death of a former colleague is associated with a transient, one-year increase in the pessimism of management forecasts. This effect is amplified when the CEO exhibits a greater resemblance or stronger attachment to the deceased. Further, we also find that the effect is less pro- nounced for CEOs who are more equipped to handle the negative emotions. Additional tests show that CEOs issue pessimistic management forecasts at a higher frequency and exhibit more pessimistic tones in speech during conference calls after the death event. Moreover, we find that CEOs make a staged re- covery as their pessimism in issuing management forecasts appears to last only about one year. Further analysis reveals that a firm's stock price crash risk significantly decreases following the death event. Overall, this study extends our knowledge of transient factors by showing that grief can affect the bias contained in management forecasts.}

abstract = {This study examines the impact of financial statement comparability on ex ante crash risk. Using the comparability measures of De Franco et al. (2011), we find that expected crash risk decreases with financial statement comparability, and this negative relation is more pronounced in an environment where managers are more prone to withhold bad news. We also provide evidence that comparability can mitigate the asymmetric market reaction to bad versus good news disclosures. Our results suggest that financial statement comparability disinclines managers from bad news hoarding, which reduces investors' perceptions of a firm's future crash risk.},
